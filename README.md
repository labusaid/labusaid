### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My github is a bit of a mess between hackathon projects and coding assignments.
I'm currently in the process of creating writeups for some of my older projects on my website [latheabusaid.com](https://latheabusaid.com). But for now my [Devpost Profile](https://devpost.com/labusaid) may provide you with some more insight.

I know forked repos also get in the way sometimes, but if it's in my profile I've either worked on it before or am currently working on it right now.

Thanks for stopping by!
