### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My github is a bit of a mess between hackathon projects and coding assignments, but the pinned projects below are good examples of some of my work.
I'm currently in the process of creating writeups for some of my older projects on my website [latheabusaid.com](https://latheabusaid.com), but for now my [Devpost Profile](https://devpost.com/labusaid) may provide you with some more insight.

Any forked repos in my profile I've either worked on in the past or am planning on contributing to in the future.

Thanks for stopping by!
